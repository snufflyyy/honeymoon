## Hello!

honeymoon is a 3d game engine i am currently working on, there really is much as of right now (as you can see) but i plan to buckle down very soon.

### why

i am making this because i have always wanted to make a game created by just my code and just my assets, i find making a game engine is the best way to do this ofc.

### how to build

you cant as of right now, but soon you will using visual studio and eventually cmake as well :)
